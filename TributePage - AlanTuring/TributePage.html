        <h2 id="headline" class="headline">A short timeline of Alan Turing's life</h2>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li>
            <strong>1912 - </strong>Born in Maida Vale, London, in the family of a civil servant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1926 - </strong>His parents sent him to Sherborne School in Dorset. There he started to show his strong
            interest in math and science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1928 - </strong>At the age of 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1930 - </strong>Turing's close friend Morcom suddenly dies. There are speculations that Morcom's
            death caused Turing to become an atheist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1931 - </strong>Turing goes to study Mathematics at King's College, Cambridge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1935 - </strong>At the age of 22, he was elected a fellow of King's on the strength of a
            dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1936 - </strong>Turing published his paper <i>On Computable Numbers and an Application to the
              Entscheidungsproblem</i> (decision problem).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938 - </strong>He received his PhD from Princeton in the US; his dissertation was called <i>Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals</i> and introduced original logic and relative computing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939 - </strong>During the Second World War, he works in Bletchley Park to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by the Germans. Turing used statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code-breaking process using probability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1941 - </strong>Proposes to his co-worker Joan Clarke. Shortly after, Turing had second thoughts, admitting to his fiancee that he was homosexual.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942 - </strong>Worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; During this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943 - </strong>Turing and colleagues manage to break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1949 - </strong>Turing became deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University, working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers – the Manchester Mark 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1950 - </strong>The ACE (Automatic Computing Engine), a computer designed by Turing, execute its first program.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>January 1952 - </strong>He published <i>The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis</i>, describing aspects of his research on the development of form and pattern in living organisms. Turing used Manchester’s Ferranti Mark I computer to model his hypothesized chemical mechanism for the generation of anatomical structure in animals and plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>March 1952 - </strong>He was convicted of “gross indecency”—that is to say, homosexuality, a crime in Britain at that time—and he was sentenced to chemical castration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1954 - </strong>Turing's housekeeper found him dead at the age of 41. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide.
          </li>

    <h2 class="apologies-header">Government apology</h2>
        <ul class="ul">
          
          <li>
            <strong>2009 - </strong>British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, speaking on behalf of the British government, publicly apologized for Turing’s “utterly unfair” treatment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014 - </strong>Queen Elizabeth II officially pronounced Turing pardoned.
